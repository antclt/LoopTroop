# Ticket Flow

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TL;DR** — A ticket flows through: scanning → interview → PRD → beads planning → execution setup → bead-by-bead coding → final test → integration → PR → cleanup (interview, PRD and beads are planning loops with LLM council drafting, voting, and refinement stages).

LoopTroop does not move a ticket through a tiny backlog -> coding -> done list. It runs a staged lifecycle with planning loops, approval gates, execution setup, bead-scoped coding, PR delivery, and explicit error recovery.

The canonical workflow metadata lives in `shared/workflowMeta.ts`, the executable transition rules live in `server/machines/ticketMachine.ts`, and the route handling lives under `server/routes/ticketHandlers/`.

## 1. At A Glance

```text
DRAFT
  -> SCANNING_RELEVANT_FILES
  -> Interview loop
  -> PRD loop
  -> Beads loop
  -> PRE_FLIGHT_CHECK
  -> WAITING_EXECUTION_SETUP_APPROVAL
  -> PREPARING_EXECUTION_ENV
  -> CODING bead loop
  -> RUNNING_FINAL_TEST
  -> INTEGRATING_CHANGES
  -> CREATING_PULL_REQUEST
  -> WAITING_PR_REVIEW
  -> CLEANING_ENV
  -> COMPLETED

Any active phase can fail into BLOCKED_ERROR.
BLOCKED_ERROR -> RETRY -> previousStatus
BLOCKED_ERROR -> CONTINUE -> previousStatus (eligible preserved OpenCode sessions only)
Any non-terminal phase -> CANCELED
WAITING_PR_REVIEW -> merge or close-unmerged -> CLEANING_ENV
```

Useful mental model:

- **Before `PRE_FLIGHT_CHECK`** you are still in editable planning territory: interview, PRD, beads, and setup artifacts can create archived versions and restart downstream work.
- **From `PRE_FLIGHT_CHECK` onward** the workflow is in execution territory: repository mutations become isolated and tightly controlled, and recovery is driven by execution locks, retries, or explicit blocked-error decisions.
- **`CODING` is the versioning exception**: retries reset the active bead/checkpoint instead of creating phase-attempt versions.

## 2. Detailed Flow Diagram

The flowchart below visualizes how tickets progress through planning, execution, and delivery, and how recovery pathways branch back to active phases:

The diagrams in this document are embedded SVGs so they render consistently in VS Code Markdown Preview.

![Detailed ticket flow diagram](./media/ticket-flow/01-2-detailed-flow-diagram.svg)

Loop semantics are omitted from the high-level chart to keep it readable:

- `WAITING_INTERVIEW_ANSWERS` can self-loop for more batches, and interview coverage can send the ticket back to answers when gaps remain.
- `VERIFYING_PRD_COVERAGE` can send the ticket back to `REFINING_PRD` until the spec is clean or the revision cap is reached.
- `VERIFYING_BEADS_COVERAGE` can send the ticket back to `REFINING_BEADS` until the blueprint is clean or the revision cap is reached.
- `CODING` repeats bead-by-bead until all executable beads are complete.
- `BLOCKED_ERROR` stores `previousStatus`, so `retry` and eligible `continue` actions both return to the interrupted phase.

## 3. State Machine Transition Model

The underlying state machine enforces valid state transitions and recovery hooks deterministically. The diagrams below show the state transitions organized by workflow phase.

### 3.1 Entry & Discovery

![Entry and discovery state diagram](./media/ticket-flow/02-3-1-entry-discovery.svg)

### 3.2 Interview Loop

![Interview loop state diagram](./media/ticket-flow/03-3-2-interview-loop.svg)

`WAITING_INTERVIEW_ANSWERS` self-loops while batches are still being answered, and `VERIFYING_INTERVIEW_COVERAGE` returns to answers when gaps require follow-up questions.

### 3.3 PRD Loop

![PRD loop state diagram](./media/ticket-flow/04-3-3-prd-loop.svg)

`VERIFYING_PRD_COVERAGE` loops back to `REFINING_PRD` whenever the candidate spec still has gaps.

### 3.4 Beads Loop

![Beads loop state diagram](./media/ticket-flow/05-3-4-beads-loop.svg)

`VERIFYING_BEADS_COVERAGE` loops back to `REFINING_BEADS` whenever the execution blueprint still misses required coverage.

### 3.5 Execution & Delivery

![Execution and delivery state diagram](./media/ticket-flow/06-3-5-execution-delivery.svg)

### 3.6 Error Recovery & Cancellation

![Error recovery and cancellation state diagram](./media/ticket-flow/07-3-6-error-recovery-cancellation.svg)

**Recovery semantics:**
- `RETRY`: Re-enters `previousStatus`; non-implementation phases archive the failed attempt and create a fresh version first, while `CODING` resets the active bead/checkpoint path instead.
- `CONTINUE`: Appears only when a preserved OpenCode session is still live and eligible; LoopTroop re-enters the interrupted phase and sends exactly `continue please`.
- `CANCEL`: Available from every non-terminal workflow state and moves the ticket to the terminal canceled state after aborting active work.

### 3.7 Coverage Control

Interview, PRD, and beads coverage loops are managed by `server/workflow/coverageControl.ts`. Each phase uses a shared `resolveCoverageRunState()` mechanism that tracks:

- **Coverage pass number**: How many times coverage has been run for the current artifact version.
- **Pass limit**: The configured cap (`maxCoveragePasses`, `maxPrdCoveragePasses`, or `maxBeadsCoveragePasses`) per coverage phase.
- **Budget**: The follow-up budget percentage that limits interview coverage depth.

`resolveCoverageGapDisposition()` determines whether the pass loop should:
- **Continue**: Gaps were found and the pass limit has not been reached — return to refinement.
- **Terminate as clean**: No gaps remain; advance to approval.
- **Terminate as capped**: Gaps remain but the pass limit is exhausted; advance to approval with warnings.

Coverage budgets and limits apply independently per phase. Interview coverage budget is shared between compiled and follow-up questions; PRD and beads coverage use only pass counts.

### 3.8 Execution Band

The execution band (`server/workflow/executionBand.ts`) is the set of statuses between pre-flight readiness and environment cleanup:

```
PRE_FLIGHT_CHECK → WAITING_EXECUTION_SETUP_APPROVAL → PREPARING_EXECUTION_ENV
  → CODING → RUNNING_FINAL_TEST → INTEGRATING_CHANGES
  → CREATING_PULL_REQUEST → WAITING_PR_REVIEW → CLEANING_ENV
```

Only one ticket per project may occupy the execution band at a time. `isExecutionBandStatus()` validates membership and the project execution lock prevents concurrent execution tickets from creating Git conflicts in the same repository.

The single-ticket lock is enforced by the **project execution lock** check during `PRE_FLIGHT_CHECK`: if another ticket for the same project is already in the execution band, the incoming ticket blocks with a concurrency error.

### Key Observations

The transition model enforces these invariants:
- **Approval Gates** are explicit workflow states, not transient UI flags.
- **The Interview Loop** can self-loop dynamically during active batching or coverage verification.
- **Spec & Blueprint Coverage Loops** remain bounded inside their groups, revising automatically until clean or capped.
- **`BLOCKED_ERROR`** stores `previousStatus` in its context to allow precise, phase-scoped recovery.
- **Cancellation** is a workflow-wide safety valve for every non-terminal state, even though the most visible decision points remain approvals, blocked errors, and PR review.
- **Archived phase attempts** preserve non-implementation retries, regenerations, and planning restarts as read-only history instead of overwriting the last run.
- **Execution-time human input** can happen without a status change when OpenCode asks a question during runtime setup or coding.

## 4. Workflow Groups & Board Locations

### Status Groups
The UI and API categorize all ticket states into distinct lifecycle groups:

| Group | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `todo` | Backlog item before AI planning activity begins. |
| `discovery` | Codebase indexing and file scanning before requirements. |
| `interview` | Questionnaire compilation, Q&A batching, coverage, and interview approval. |
| `prd` | Requirements spec drafting, voting, refinement, coverage, and PRD approval. |
| `beads` | Execution blueprint drafting, voting, refinement, coverage, expansion, and approval. |
| `pre_implementation` | Pre-flight readiness verification, runtime setup plan drafting, and tool environment setup. |
| `implementation` | Bead-by-bead isolated coding loop. |
| `post_implementation` | Holistic testing, branch squashing, PR publishing, review gates, and worktree cleanup. |
| `done` | Successful completion or cancellation. |
| `errors` | The dedicated recovery gateway for blocked errors. |

### Kanban Board Locations
Every ticket belongs to exactly one Kanban board location determined by its `kanbanPhase`. These locations simplify board layout by indicating who or what owns the next move:

| Board Location | `kanbanPhase` | Meaning | Included Statuses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **To Do** | `todo` | Inactive backlog item. | `DRAFT` |
| **Needs Input** | `needs_input` | Paused; waiting for user action, approval, or error recovery. | Interview Q&A, all approvals, PR review, and `BLOCKED_ERROR`. |
| **In Progress** | `in_progress` | Active; LoopTroop is running background calculations, councils, or coding sessions. | Scanning, deliberating, voting, refining, preparing, coding, testing, squashing. |
| **Done** | `done` | Terminal status. | `COMPLETED`, `CANCELED` |

*Note: `BLOCKED_ERROR` maps to `needs_input` rather than a unique board column, because recovery requires manual retry, session continuation, or cancellation.*

## 5. Phase Inventory

The canonical properties for every workflow phase are detailed in the inventory below:

| Phase | Label | Group | `uiView` | `kanbanPhase` | Review Artifact | Editable | Multi-Model Logs | Progress Indicator |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `CANCELED` | Canceled | `done` | `canceled` | `done` | — | no | no | — |
| `BLOCKED_ERROR` | Error | `errors` | `error` | `needs_input` | — | no | no | — |

**Note:** `editable: yes` means the review artifact or planning document can be manually saved from that phase. Interview and PRD edits are accepted only before `PRE_FLIGHT_CHECK`; setup-plan edits are also accepted during `PREPARING_EXECUTION_ENV`, where they trigger a one-step rewind back to setup approval.

---

## 6. UI & Frontend Consequences

The state machine metadata directly drives the React user interface. Developers modifying the workflow must ensure backend descriptors align, as:
- **`uiView`** decides which top-level layout panel is mounted (e.g., `council`, `approval`, `interview_qa`).
- **`reviewArtifactType`** controls which approval schema editor and custom comparison components are loaded.
- **`progressKind`** controls specialized progress tracking visuals (e.g., question batch tallies vs. bead graph lists).
- **`editable`** toggles raw markdown edit boxes for planning and setup specs.
- **`multiModelLogs`** decides whether the UI should search for multi-agent council tabs and scoring matrices or render single-model log output.
- **`phaseAttempt`-scoped artifact/log loading** keeps archived retries and regenerations separated from the live SSE stream.

---

## 7. Status-By-Status Detail

### Entry & Discovery
- **`DRAFT`:** Backlog item. Ticket metadata (title, description, assignee) can be edited freely. No worktree isolation or AI routines have run. Exiting via `start` triggers indexing.
- **`SCANNING_RELEVANT_FILES`:** The Main Implementer scans the project folder under AI Response Timeout and registers target files, writing results to `.ticket/relevant-files.yaml`.

### Interview Loop
- **`COUNCIL_DELIBERATING`:** All configured council members draft interview strategies in parallel, producing candidate question lists.
- **`COUNCIL_VOTING_INTERVIEW`:** Council models rate the anonymized questionnaires using a structural rubric to select the best intake framework.
- **`COMPILING_INTERVIEW`:** LoopTroop normalizes the selected plan into the canonical `interview.yaml` session file.
- **`WAITING_INTERVIEW_ANSWERS`:** The dashboard pauses for user answers. Questions are presented in adaptive, dynamic batches of 1 to 3 to optimize cognitive load. Skip and "skip all" choices are supported.
- **`VERIFYING_INTERVIEW_COVERAGE`:** The winner checks the answers for ambiguities or gaps, spawning targeted follow-up rounds if budget permits.
- **`WAITING_INTERVIEW_APPROVAL`:** Gatekeeper review. The user approves the structured YAML specs with content-hash protection (`expectedContentSha256` matching check).

### Specs Loop (PRD)
- **`DRAFTING_PRD`:** Models resolve skipped questions into a Full Answers artifact (`answered_by: ai_skip`), then draft comprehensive feature requirements.
- **`COUNCIL_VOTING_PRD`:** Anonymized votes are cast on rival PRD drafts based on completeness, risk, and feasibility metrics.
- **`REFINING_PRD`:** The winner incorporates the strongest elements from competing drafts into PRD Candidate v1.
- **`VERIFYING_PRD_COVERAGE`:** The candidate PRD is audited against the approved Full Answers context, revising in-phase until clean or capped.
- **`WAITING_PRD_APPROVAL`:** Gatekeeper review of the PRD requirements spec with content-hash matching, supported by the winning Full Answers reference context.

### Blueprint Loop (Beads)
- **`DRAFTING_BEADS`:** Council members draft blueprints decomposing the approved spec into semantic dependency graphs of beads.
- **`COUNCIL_VOTING_BEADS`:** Blueprints are rated on graph logic, file target isolation, and testing strategy.
- **`REFINING_BEADS`:** Winning blueprint merges strong verification steps from alternative drafts.
- **`VERIFYING_BEADS_COVERAGE`:** Blueprint is verified against the PRD, revising in-phase when missing criteria are found.
- **`EXPANDING_BEADS`:** LoopTroop expands the blueprint into live execution bead lists, specifying exact file scopes and test suites.
- **`WAITING_BEADS_APPROVAL`:** Gatekeeper review of the dependency graph and executable plan before coding starts.

### Pre-Implementation
- **`PRE_FLIGHT_CHECK`:** Verifies workspace sanitation, Git worktree hygiene, OpenCode reachability, and execution locks. Committable changes outside LoopTroop fail the checks.
- **`WAITING_EXECUTION_SETUP_APPROVAL`:** The setup-plan draft presents the readiness assessment, required temporary setup steps, and regenerate history. The user can approve, edit, or regenerate it with commentary.
- **`PREPARING_EXECUTION_ENV`:** Runs only the approved temporary setup, verifies wrappers/probes, may perform setup-scoped online lookup, and emits the reusable execution-setup profile under `.ticket/runtime/execution-setup/**`.

### Implementation (Coding)
- **`CODING`:** The executor processes one bead at a time in dependency order. The agent gets narrow contexts and structured completion reminders. Uncommitted project changes are captured in local bead commits, while retries reset the active bead/checkpoint rather than creating a new phase attempt.

### Post-Implementation & Delivery
- **`RUNNING_FINAL_TEST`:** The implementer constructs a whole-ticket test plan, executes it with the approved runtime profile, and records a final-test file-effects audit alongside the test outputs.
- **`INTEGRATING_CHANGES`:** Squashes bead-level changes and audited candidate files into a clean candidate commit on the main ticket branch. If final testing produced unclassified files, integration blocks for a human include/discard decision.
- **`CREATING_PULL_REQUEST`:** Performs a final candidate audit (reconciling inclusions/exclusions) before pushing the branch and drafting the PR title/description.
- **`WAITING_PR_REVIEW`:** Review window. Exits successfully via `merge` (which locks, checks, and finishes) or `close_unmerged`.
- **`CLEANING_ENV`:** Deletes transient lockfiles, wrapper hooks, and session directories, preserving planning files and audit trails.

### Error & Terminal States
- **`BLOCKED_ERROR`:** Recovery gate that preserves `previousStatus`, structured diagnostics, and any continuation candidate. Depending on the failure, the user can retry, continue a preserved OpenCode session, resolve final-test file-effects, or cancel.
- **`COMPLETED`:** Terminal success state after cleanup finishes and execution locks are released. Ticket artifacts, logs, and archived attempts remain available for audit.
- **`CANCELED`:** Terminal stop state for user-driven cancellation or intentional planning rewinds. Existing artifacts/history remain, but no further automation continues.

## 8. User Actions & Guard Systems

`getAvailableWorkflowActions()` defines the static action floor, and the server adds dynamic actions for resumable OpenCode sessions and final-test file-effects recovery. In practice, the main user actions are:

| Where | Main actions | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DRAFT` | `start`, `cancel` | `start` locks the ticket's model/configuration choices and creates the isolated workspace. |
| `WAITING_INTERVIEW_ANSWERS` | batch answer, edit answer, skip all, `cancel` | Interview input is batch-oriented; `skip all` writes a synthetic clean coverage result and jumps straight to interview approval. |
| Approval gates | `approve`, `cancel` | Interview, PRD, beads, and setup-plan approvals require `expectedContentSha256`; stale approvals return `409` instead of advancing. |
| `WAITING_EXECUTION_SETUP_APPROVAL` / `PREPARING_EXECUTION_ENV` | edit, regenerate, approve/rewind | Setup-plan saves or regenerations during runtime setup stop the active setup session, archive the current setup/runtime attempts, preserve the tool cache, and require approval again. |
| `WAITING_PR_REVIEW` | `merge`, `close_unmerged`, `cancel` | Review resolution decides whether the ticket exits with a merged PR or a closed unmerged branch. |
| `BLOCKED_ERROR` | `retry`, optional `continue`, optional file-effects overrides, `cancel` | `continue` appears only when a preserved OpenCode session is still live. `include-final-test-files` / `discard-final-test-files` appear only for `FINAL_TEST_FILE_EFFECTS_UNCLASSIFIED`. |
| Any other non-terminal status | `cancel` | Cancellation is not limited to gates; the route accepts it from every non-terminal workflow state. |
| `PREPARING_EXECUTION_ENV` / `CODING` | reply/reject OpenCode questions | OpenCode can request human input mid-session without changing the main ticket status; answering or rejecting the request unblocks that live session in place. |

### Planning Edit Restarts
Approved interview and PRD documents can still be edited manually while in planning (before `PRE_FLIGHT_CHECK`). Saving manual changes triggers session cancellation downstream to keep artifacts consistent:
- Editing **Interview** from PRD/Beads archives the approved interview, aborts downstream sessions, clears downstream drafts, saves/approves the edit, and jumps to `DRAFTING_PRD`.
- Editing **PRD** from Beads archives the approved PRD, aborts downstream sessions, clears downstream blueprint drafts, saves/approves the edit, and jumps to `DRAFTING_BEADS`.
- Editing or regenerating the **Execution Setup Plan** while `PREPARING_EXECUTION_ENV` is active performs a runtime rewind: LoopTroop stops setup, archives both setup attempts, preserves `.ticket/runtime/execution-setup/tool-cache`, clears stale runtime outputs, returns to `WAITING_EXECUTION_SETUP_APPROVAL`, and requires a fresh approval before setup resumes.

---

## 9. Retry, Continue, And Blocked-Error Semantics

When a phase encounters a fatal block, it routes to `BLOCKED_ERROR` while storing the failed status in `previousStatus`. Recovery pathways are phase-scoped:

### The Retry Path (`RETRY`)
- Archives the active phase attempt and initializes a fresh run.
- **Planning Phases:** Manual retries create a new version of the draft spec or blueprint in the UI.
- **`CODING` Exception:** `CODING` does not create new phase attempts. It runs a bead-scoped recovery loop: resets the active bead's worktree back to its recorded `beadStartCommit` snapshot and schedules it again.

### The Continue Path (`CONTINUE`)
- Resumes an in-progress session without resetting or creating new attempts.
- Used for continuable, transient errors (HTTP 402, rate/usage limits, overload capacity, provider timeouts) where the remote OpenCode session is still active and addressable.
- LoopTroop locks onto the preserved session and sends exactly:
  ```text
  continue please
  ```

### Phase Attempts And Version History
- Every non-implementation manual retry archives the failed phase attempt and creates a fresh active attempt; artifacts and logs can later be inspected through `phaseAttempt`-scoped history.
- Setup-plan regenerations and post-approval planning edits follow the same versioned-history model instead of overwriting the last approved generation.
- `CODING` is the exception: recovery stays bead-scoped (`bead_execution:*` artifacts, checkpoint finalization, and worktree reset) rather than creating phase-attempt versions.

## 10. Safe Resume & Interruption Recovery

LoopTroop is designed to survive crashes, restarts, and disconnects. The table below outlines how specific interruption events are safely handled:

| Interruption | Expected Resume Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Browser Closes / SSE Disconnects** | The next UI mount requests the Hono server REST state. SSE reconnects pass `Last-Event-ID` to replay stream indicators without reloading active panels. |
| **Frontend Crashes** | Active draft forms and interview inputs are written to local ticket UI-state files on page unload. |
| **Backend Process Restarts** | LoopTroop validates the serialized XState snapshot on startup: valid snapshots are rehydrated and immediately processed, resuming the active task; corrupt states trigger `BLOCKED_ERROR`. |
| **OpenCode Server Restarts** | LoopTroop queries local `opencode_sessions` active keys; missing sessions are cleanly abandoned, and fresh contexts are created. |
| **Model Fails / Returns Garbage** | Planning phases run automatic structured retries; rejected attempts are saved as Raw attempts for inspection. |

---

## 11. Artifact Checkpoints

Durable checkpoints are saved to the project directory at critical milestones:

| Point in Flow | Durable Artifact Location / State |
| --- | --- |
| **Discovery** | `.ticket/relevant-files.yaml` index + companion scanner results. |
| **Interview** | `.ticket/interview.yaml` + Q&A snapshots + progress markers. |
| **PRD Specs** | `.ticket/prd.yaml` + per-model Full Answers + candidate coverage histories. |
| **Blueprints** | `.ticket/beads/<flow>/.beads/issues.jsonl` + coverage reports. |
| **Pre-Implementation** | `execution_setup_plan` artifacts + generation reports + approved SHA hashes + `.ticket/runtime/execution-setup-profile.json`. |
| **Execution** | `.ticket/runtime/execution-log.jsonl` + setup profile/tool cache + bead notes, checkpoints, and diffs. |
| **Recovery & History** | Archived phase attempts, `final_test_file_effects_audit`, continuation candidates, and read-only prior planning generations addressable by `phaseAttempt`. |
| **Edits** | Append-only `user_edit_receipt:*` documents recording change differentials and approval resets. |
| **Delivery** | Holistic test plans, file-effects audits, and Git PR creation reports. |

---

## 12. Advanced Workflow Mechanics

Several orchestrator modules drive the complex mechanics behind the scenes:

- **Coverage Control (`server/workflow/coverageControl.ts`)**: Manages the PRD and Beads coverage tracking loops, determining whether candidate specs have gaps and whether follow-up verification rounds are needed.
- **Execution Band (`server/workflow/executionBand.ts`)**: Demarcates the boundary between planning (editable, cancellable restarts) and runtime execution (strict isolated worktree changes).
- **Phase Attempts (`server/storage/ticketPhaseAttempts.ts`)**: Versions non-implementation retries, setup-plan regenerations, and archived planning generations so prior artifacts stay immutable.
- **Session Logging (`server/workflow/sessionStatusLogging.ts`)**: Handles the durable recording of session state transitions and OpenCode interactions.
- **Integration Phase (`server/workflow/phases/integrationPhase.ts`)**: Orchestrates the commit squashing and target branch integration logic after coding and final tests are complete.
- **Execution Setup Phase (`server/workflow/phases/executionSetupPlanPhase.ts`)**: Manages the pre-flight checks and setup plan drafting, explicitly separating environment prep from active bead coding.
- **Ticket Handlers (`server/routes/ticketHandlers/**`)**: Implement the route-driven behaviors that sit around the state machine edges, including approval hashes, planning restarts, setup rewinds, blocked-error recovery actions, and OpenCode question replies.
